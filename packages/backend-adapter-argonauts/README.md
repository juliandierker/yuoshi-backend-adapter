# yUOShi Backend Adapter for Stud.IP
This repository contains a package to adapt [yUOShi](https://github.com/juliandierker/yUOShi) to
a Stud.IP-Instance that has the [xyng/yuoshi-studip-plugin](https://github.com/xyng/yuoshi-studip-plugin)
extension installed.

This package is only meant to be installed inside the yUOShi application. It is not guaranteed to work or
make sense somewhere else (although it should work pretty much everywhere given a recent JS-Environment)

## Installation
Install this package with any node package manager of your choice (like `npm` or `yarn`):
```
@xyng/yuoshi-backend-adapter-argonauts
```
