# Request-Adapter for yUOShi Backend Adapter
This is an implementation for a request-adapter as required by the `@xyng/yuoshi-backend-adapter` package.
It is based on `axios`.

This package is designed to work with the aforementioned adapter software and there being imported by the yUOShi-System.
If you need a request library for another project, please consider using `axios` directly.
It's pretty good out of the box and this package does not really do more than put a small consistent api-wrapper around it.

## Installation
Install this package with any node package manager of your choice (like `npm` or `yarn`):
```
@xyng/yuoshi-request-adapter-axios
```
